We assumed that missing `r outcomes_name` data
were missing at random (MAR)
[@rubin1976inference, @little2019statistical].
As the longitudinal cohorts evolved over time,
new instruments were adopted and added;
much of the missingness was due to
adding additional measures in later time.
The MAR assumption thus seems plausible.
We substituted missing outcome event data
by assigning a probability distribution across the
possible values of the missing variable
that matched the marginal distribution of observed data
among the cases.
For example,
`r n_missing` of the `r length(x1)` cases (`r pct_missing`)
had missing values for ataxia severity,
and `r n_obs` (`r pct_obs`) had recorded values,
distributed among ataxia severity levels 0-4
(`r v1_usable_cases$"Ataxia: severity*" |> counts_and_pcts() |> and::and()`,
respectively).
For the `r n_missing` cases with missing values,
we assigned probabilities of `r probs |> and::and()`
to ataxia severity levels `r 0:4 |> and::and()`, respectively,
and missing values were imputed under the marginal distribution
of the observed data.
