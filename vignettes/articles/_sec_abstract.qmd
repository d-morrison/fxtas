The fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a
neurodegenerative disorder caused by the
premutation (55 to 200 CGG repeats) in 
the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein-1 (*FMR1*) gene.
An open question is:
In what sequential order do
FXTAS symptoms typically appear,
and how does that sequence vary
among patients and
between males and females?

We applied the
ordinal-outcomes version of the
Subtype and Stage Inference algorithm ("Ordinal SuStaIn") to
identify the sequential events of
clinical and brain MRI changes
in observed data
collected in FXTAS patients at stages 0-5.
We included `r length(biomarker_varnames)` neurodegenerative symptoms 
collected from `r nrow(v1_usable_cases)` premutation carriers 
(`r nrow(v1_usable_female_cases)` females 
and `r nrow(v1_usable_male_cases)` males)
and `r nrow(controls_v1)` controls 
(`r nrow(v1_usable_female_controls)` females 
and `r nrow(v1_usable_male_controls)` males),
aged `r min(v1_usable$"Age at visit")` 
- `r max(v1_usable$"Age at visit") |> round()`
years old at entry,
who participated in two longitudinal studies,
with entry dates between `r min_year` - `r max_year`.

We found
substantial differences in order of events
depending on sex,
and possibly in combination of sex and CGG repeats.
The main finding is 
the predominance of the psychiatric co-morbidities
that occur early in females 
(often before the onset of tremor and ataxia) compared to males. 
Females appear to experience early cognitive problems 
involving executive dysfunction and memory 
in comparison to males. 

These findings suggest that the sequence of neuropsychiatric symptoms
for FXTAS is different in females compared to males, 
particularly for early symptoms in disease development and progression.
This could lead to sex-specific modifications 
of the FXTAS diagnostic stages.
