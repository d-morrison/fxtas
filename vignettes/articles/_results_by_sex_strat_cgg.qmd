@fig-pvd-by-gender-cgg_under100 shows the estimated event sequences
for CGG < 100 stratified by sex
and compares the estimated event sequences between males and females.
We found statistically significant evidence of a difference between males and females
among those with CGG < 100 (p = `r pval_under100_sex_gp34_v1`).
Several psychiatric disorders (as measured by SCID) occurred prior to FXTAS Stage 1
among females with CGG < 100,
but at later FXTAS stages for males with CGG < 100.
MRI biomarkers appeared to occur at later stages in females compared to males.

We did not find statistically significant evidence of a difference between males and females
among those with CGG ≥ 100 (p = `r pval_over100_sex_gp34_v1`).
@fig-pvd-by-gender-cgg_over100 shows the estimated stratified models
and compares the estimates of the sequences.
The significant differences found for these subgroups
need to be declared with caution due to the small sample sizes
and large uncertainty..
