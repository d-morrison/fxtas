We applied a discrete event-based disease progression model 
[@fonteijn2011event; @fonteijn2012event; @oxtoby2023data] 
to our data using the Ordinal Subtype and Stage Inference ("SuStaIn") algorithm 
[@young2021ordinal] 
to estimate event orderings and subtypes for FXTAS patients. 
SuStaIn is a data-driven statistical modeling algorithm 
that combines 
event-based disease progression modelling 
[@fonteijn2011event; @fonteijn2012event; @oxtoby2023data]
and latent-cluster finite mixture modeling 
[@pearson1894contributions; @lazarsfeld1950logical; @mclachlan2019finite] 
to model event sequences 
using cross-sectional samples of patient and control populations. 
The algorithm simultaneously 
clusters individuals into latent subtypes and 
characterizes the event ordering that best defines each subtype, 
thus capturing heterogeneity in both disease subtype and disease stage.

Ordinal SuStaIn [@young2021ordinal] is 
a version of the SuStaIn modeling algorithm [@young2018uncovering],
adapted for analyzing ordinal-valued data.
Ordinal SuStaIn uses a "scored events model", 
which assumes that for each `r outcomes_name`,
there is a discrete set of 
underlying ordinal severity levels,
but the measured versions of the `r outcomes_name`s may contain 
some amount of random noise.
For example, a patient who was really at ataxia severity level 2 
may be incorrectly assessed as being at ataxia severity level 1, 
depending on 
the patient's temporary disease status on the day of the exam 
or inter-rater differences.
The first step in applying the Ordinal SuStaIn algorithm is to determine,
for each `r outcomes_name`, the probability that an individual is 
"correctly scored" at their "true underlying level" [@young2021ordinal].
In this analysis, we assumed that all controls are truly at the reference levels
for each `r outcomes_name`, 
and we estimated the proportion of correctly scored individuals as
the proportion of controls 
who were assessed as being at the reference level
(@supptbl-prob-correct).
It is crucial to allow some possibility of incorrect scoring, 
so we capped the estimated correct scoring probabilities at 
`r max_prob_correct *100`%.

Ordinal SuStaIn then uses 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling [@gelfand1990sampling]
to estimate the Bayesian posterior probability of each possible event sequence 
for each subtype given the training dataset, 
assuming a uniform prior distribution 
over the set of all possible orderings. 
We conducted subgroup analyses by fitting models stratified by
sex ([Sex differences in sequential order](#sec-methods-strat-sex)), 
CGG repeats (<100 vs ≥100) (Supplementary material, [Analyses stratified by CGG repeats](#sec-methods-strat-cgg)),
and combinations of sex and CGG repeats (<100 vs ≥100) 
(Supplementary material, [Comparing sexes stratified by CGG level](#sec-stratified-by-cgg-and-sex)).
In these subgroup analyses, we did not search for latent clusters.
