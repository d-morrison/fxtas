This study has several limitations.
In the subtype clustering analysis,
it was challenging to concisely summarize
the differences between subtypes,
especially given the relatively small sample sizes per subtype
and the correspondingly large amounts of uncertainty
in their event orderings.
We had substantial amounts of missing data.
As described in the methods ([Imputation of missing data](#sec-incomplete-data)),
we used the marginal distribution of
the observed data for each `r outcomes_name` among cases
to impute the underlying values of these missing data.
The missing data could contribute to uncertainty in the results.
Our data contained both continuous and ordinal variables.
In order to apply the Ordinal SuStaIn algorithm,
we categorized some `r outcomes_name`s
that were originally measured as continuous values.
In doing so, we likely sacrificed some granular information.
There are other variations of the SuStaIn algorithm,
such as z-score SuStaIn [@young2018uncovering],
which are designed to be used with only continuous measurements.
Further development is warranted to combine Ordinal SuStaIn and z-score SuStaIn
to fit an event-based model with both continuous and ordinal data.

Our data come from the GP and TRAX studies,
which are longitudinal cohort studies
with infrequent follow-up visits.
These studies do not collect precise information
about timing of symptom onsets,
so it is not feasible to use the longitudinal data
to confirm the results from the Ordinal SuStaIn analysis.
In our analysis approach,
the event onsets are not modeled as a function of participant age;
instead, each event's onset timing is only modeled relative to the other events.
Therefore, the sequence differences between the subtypes
are all in relative terms:
if one event moves earlier in the sequence
when comparing one subtype to another,
other events are pushed later in the sequence,
even if only one event timing
changes relative to age.
Additional research including longitudinal data
collecting precise ages of onset
would be needed to verify our findings.
