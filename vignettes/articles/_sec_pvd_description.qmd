We visualized the results of Ordinal SuStaIn analysis
using "positional variance diagrams" (PVDs).
PVDs are heatmaps with `r events_name` on the y-axis
and sequence positions of events on the x-axis.
Each event is estimated to occur at some point in continuing time
*relative to* other events in sequence.
It should be noted that the exact onset time of each event
cannot be determined by the method we used for this analysis.
The PVD's color scale indicates the Bayesian posterior probability that
a particular event (y-axis)
appears at a particular position along the progression sequence (x-axis).
The different colors (red, blue, purple, green, magenta)
indicate the ordinal levels of symptom progression.
Color intensity presents the likelihood of sequence position.
That is, a brighter color indicates a more probable sequence position,
and a paler color indicates a less probable position.
