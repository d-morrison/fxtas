The fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a
neurodegenerative disorder caused by the
premutation (55 to 200 CGG repeats) in the
fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein-1 (*FMR1*) gene [@hagerman2001intention].
The premutation is associated with
elevation of the *FMR1* mRNA.
The RNA toxicity 
due to the elevated expression levels of the *FMR1* mRNA leads to 
oxidative stress,
mitochondrial dysfunction,
calcium dysregulation, and
sequestration of proteins important to neuronal function

Eosinophilic, tau-negative intranuclear inclusions are present
in neurons and astrocytes throughout the CNS and
in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) 
[@greco2006neuropathology; @hunter2012capturing].
FXTAS is a late-onset disorder, usually occurring in the 60s
though some patients have an earlier onset,
and its signs and symptoms worsen with age.
As premutation carriers age,
the prevalence of FXTAS increases from approximately
40% in males in their 60s to
75% in their 80s [@jacquemont2004penetrance].
Females with the premutation are also at risk for FXTAS,
but the prevalence is lower;
approximately 20% may develop FXTAS,
and it is usually less severe than in males [@tassone2023insight].
In general
for males with FXTAS,
the higher the CGG repeat number within the premutation range,
the earlier onset of FXTAS,
and earlier death [@greco2006neuropathology].
The prevalence of the premutation is estimated at
one in 148 to 200 females and
one in 290 to 855 males
in the general population [@maenner2013fmr1; @hunter2014epidemiology].

The symptoms of FXTAS appear and develop over many years in adulthood, 
usually after age 50, and include 
tremor, 
gait ataxia, 
neuropathy, 
cognitive decline, 
and depressive and anxiety disorders
[@hagerman2001intention].
Both the type and severity of FXTAS symptoms vary among patients. 
Some patients with FXTAS have multiple symptoms that 
progress rapidly in severity, 
while others have few symptoms that remain mild over many years. 
The sequence in which those symptoms typically appear 
is still understudied,
but it could help us to understand the disease process and its variability across patients.
Therefore, the present study attempts to address the following questions:
1) In what sequential order do 
FXTAS symptoms and brain changes typically appear?
2) How does that sequence vary among patients?
and 3) Do specific baseline characteristics predict the order of presentation?

Here, we applied the ordinal-outcomes version of the
Subtype and Stage Inference algorithm
("Ordinal SuStaIn") [@young2018uncovering; @young2021ordinal]
to model sequential orders of clinically manifest FXTAS symptoms
in a cohort of FXTAS patients.
SuStaIn is a data-driven analytic approach
which was originally developed to
analyze cross-sectional biomarker data
to simultaneously
(1) estimate the ordering of onset 
for biomarkers of disease progression events and
(2) cluster study participants into 
latent subtypes with different event orderings.
The SuStaIn modeling approach has been applied to
Alzheimer's disease
[@young2018uncovering; @young2021ordinal; @vogel2021four; @collij2022spatial],
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [@young2023data],
Parkinson's disease [@zhou2022two; @sakato2024],
primary tauopathies [@scotton2023disease],
frontotemporal dementia [@young2018uncovering],
multiple sclerosis [@eshaghi2021identifying],
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [@young2020disease],
and knee osteoarthritis [@li2021identifying],
but not previously for FXTAS.
In this study we applied it to a cross-sectional data set of
premutation carriers diagnosed with FXTAS at different clinical stages
to study the sequential ordering of FXTAS `r events_name`.
